# My First Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Overview

This project is my first attempt at creating a Progressive Web App (PWA). It is designed to be a simple, responsive, and installable web application that works across multiple devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. The PWA is built using modern web technologies to provide an app-like experience.

## Features

- **Offline Support:** The app can be used offline with the help of service workers.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Installable:** Users can install the app on their devices for a native app experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS3:** Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Dynamic behavior and interactivity.
- **Service Workers:** Caching and offline functionality.
- **Web App Manifest:** Metadata for PWA installation.

## Installation

To install the app, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SergioHs/mypwa.git
   cd mypwa
